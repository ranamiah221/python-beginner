# Depth-First Search (DFS) Grid Traversal ‚Äì AI Lab Report 01

## üîç Overview

This project is an academic implementation of the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm, developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSE 316)** at Green University of Bangladesh.

The program generates a random `N x N` grid (where `N` is between 4 and 7), places a **source** and **goal** node on non-obstacle positions, and uses DFS to find a path between them. It visually represents the grid, path, and traversal order.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand how the DFS algorithm works.
- Generate a random grid with obstacles (`#`) and free paths (`.`).
- Ensure the source and goal nodes are placed on free cells.
- Traverse the grid using DFS and track visited nodes.
- Display the final path and traversal order.

---

## üß† Core Features

- Random `N √ó N` grid generation with `.`, `#` symbols.
- Random selection of source (`S`) and goal (`G`) on valid paths.
- DFS-based pathfinding.
- Output visualization in console:
  - `S`: Start
  - `G`: Goal
  - `*`: Path from source to goal
- Tracks topological order of DFS traversal.
